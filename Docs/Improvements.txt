- Made the code testable and wrote some tests, admittedly not tests that cover all scenarios
- Renamed the solution and project and folders to approporate names
- Updated projects to a newer .NET version
- Splitt the console output and SodaMachine functionality in two projects using inheritance. This has the advantages of:
	- Separating the logic so it is easier to read
	- Allowing an natural addition or replacement of the Console user gui with for an example an forms gui
	- Allows it to be more easily converted to an web api since now SodaMachine contains most logic.
	- Makes it more testable, ideally I would make a fully fledged test suite for the SodaMachine class
	- Encapsulating all console output logic and behavior in the SodaSystems.Console project
- Much more dry code, especially for the order and order sms command.
- Less code indention debth for order and order sms
- More robust insert command, not crashing
- Insert do not support 0 or negative input, which seems like a reasonable domain assumption, might be wrong thou.
- Inventory now considered the "configuration" and input of the SodaMachine
- Allow unit cost as part of inventory configuration
- Prettier and more consistent console output
- And several other minor structural or code style improvements
